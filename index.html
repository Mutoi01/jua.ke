          <h2>A Road Trip Misadventure.</h2>

          <h3>Micheal Muriuki</h3>

          <p>There will be fun to be heard somewhere.
            Will you be there to have it? Is it likely to be your kind of fun? If for some
            reasons it involves you or you are included in the plans of others to have fun
            where you are present, will you take offence. Shall it end up being a story for
            a media blitz?</p>
            <p>Three middle aged friends decided to set out on a trip work hard play hard
              types the open miles on black asphalt to exotica rural rusty towns, a pinch of
              debauchery washed down with fine scotch whiskey is just what the doctor
              ordered One brings the car, the other buys the booze the last one brings the
              girls and pays for the accommodation Alibis are an individual problem.
              No one is ready not sure where the booty traps set. It is the girls stupid! Too
              gang no! is a cause for concern, they do tend to be clingy long after the
              Jonnies are back to the hard work.</p>

              <p>The potential for sneak photograph they
                after used to blackmail the respectable seniors is another.
                The unexpected however is the demure, quiet types. Reluctant drinkers with
                naivete written all over them. The torrid suggestion is that there may be some
                virgins in the crew...

          <h3>Micheal Muriuki</h3>

          <p>The Greeks enduring gift to the world is democracy. The city states, well not
            so much, though from where I stand, I would always sooner take the city
            state over any purport of democracy.
            I do call it purport, for simplified bare bones it means representative rule. Part
            time nihilists like myself who believe in absolute freedom, Rule and rules are
            an anthem of. Outside of myself it is still hard to find out how or why any one
            person or group of persons should have the right and power to rule over the
            rest. Consensual tyranny is still tyranny. I digress, back to democracy. </p>
            <p> Does
              voting give you any right or does it make you the unwilling unwitting
              automation.
              Let's start at the bottom. Electing an MCA (member of county Assembly) to
              represent 10,000 or more people in a geographical area they have absolutely
              no say in determining Some of the voters would rather be in a different ward
              where service delivery is better. You do not choose the candidates, the party
              or the area.The idiot you like the least is some kind of comedic flirt...</p>

          <h2>Not Believing.</h2>

          <h3>Bingi Ras</h3>

          <p>I did believe in a God, though I never was sure what that was, its parameters
            or even why. I did entertain a lot of doubts throughout that phase. Finally, the
            doubts won. There was no way I'd be satisfied with answer like "God works
            in mysterious ways" or "that is beyond human knowledge"
            I was perplexed by the admonishment when I asked who created God and I
            was told that that is a blasphemous question.
            I live without faith and I am great for the most part. When I want anything, I
            craft ways and means to get it </p>
            <p> I do not pray for it. I have ample evidence
              that prayer does not work. It mesmerizing to see the contortion Christians
              especially go through in their abusive romance with their God.
              A loved one gets sick. They pray for his healing. He gets well through the
              efforts of the medical personnel as well as the medicine. They can't seem to
              shut up about the boundless mercy and love that brought healing A few
              months later, a different loved one gets sick and after much prayer in the
              same fashion and zest, he dies. The story changes, it is not mercy, love and
              healing now!! Its mysterious ways Gods will and God had a good reason that
              we may not know" or even the ultimate." God want to show us how much he
              loves us
              One guy lives, God loves him. Another guy dies, well God loves us! Speaking
              from both sides of the mouth is something Christians have mastered...</p>
