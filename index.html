          <h2>A Road Trip Misadventure.</h2>

          <h3>Micheal Muriuki</h3>

          <p>There will be fun to be heard somewhere.
            Will you be there to have it? Is it likely to be your kind of fun? If for some
            reasons it involves you or you are included in the plans of others to have fun
            where you are present, will you take offence. Shall it end up being a story for
            a media blitz?</p>
            <p>Three middle aged friends decided to set out on a trip work hard play hard
              types the open miles on black asphalt to exotica rural rusty towns, a pinch of
              debauchery washed down with fine scotch whiskey is just what the doctor
              ordered One brings the car, the other buys the booze the last one brings the
              girls and pays for the accommodation Alibis are an individual problem.
              No one is ready not sure where the booty traps set. It is the girls stupid! Too
              gang no! is a cause for concern, they do tend to be clingy long after the
              Jonnies are back to the hard work.</p>

              <p>The potential for sneak photograph they
                after used to blackmail the respectable seniors is another.
                The unexpected however is the demure, quiet types. Reluctant drinkers with
                naivete written all over them. The torrid suggestion is that there may be some
                virgins in the crew...

          <h3>Micheal Muriuki</h3>

          <p>The Greeks enduring gift to the world is democracy. The city states, well not
            so much, though from where I stand, I would always sooner take the city
            state over any purport of democracy.
            I do call it purport, for simplified bare bones it means representative rule. Part
            time nihilists like myself who believe in absolute freedom, Rule and rules are
            an anthem of. Outside of myself it is still hard to find out how or why any one
            person or group of persons should have the right and power to rule over the
            rest. Consensual tyranny is still tyranny. I digress, back to democracy. </p>
            <p> Does
              voting give you any right or does it make you the unwilling unwitting
              automation.
              Let's start at the bottom. Electing an MCA (member of county Assembly) to
              represent 10,000 or more people in a geographical area they have absolutely
              no say in determining Some of the voters would rather be in a different ward
              where service delivery is better. You do not choose the candidates, the party
              or the area.The idiot you like the least is some kind of comedic flirt...</p>
